                  <p>I’ve been wondering myself why I don’t write to you. I thought it has to do
                     with the part that I’ve been feeling I was taken away from you or that you sent
                     me away from you with your permission. On the whole, things are going rather
                     well so far. M.C.A., our agents, and Stein, our lawyer are, have dealt dealing
                     with Natasha but, we’ll see - I have a strange feeling about Paula. I mean, she
                     works differently than Lee. Anyway I keep feeling I won’t be able to do the
                     part when I have too it like a horrible nightmare. but she is a wonderful and
                     warm person - which also bewilders me Also I guess I didn’t write you before
                     this because I was waiting to see if I would get shot-first. Arthur writes me
                     every day, at least that it gives me a little air to breathe, I can't get used
                     to the fact that he loves me and I keep waiting for him to stop loving me
                     though I hope he never will, but I keep telling myself, who knows?</p>
